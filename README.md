# codecademy_feature_engineering_PCA

### PCA Project

In this project, you will classify particles into gamma(signal) or hadrons(background). Given that the features are correlated, you will perform PCA to get a new set of features, and select the features that contain the most information. The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).

The first part of the project ‘Observing the Dataset’ is in PCA_part1.ipynb and the second part of the project ‘Performing PCA’ is in PCA_part2.ipynb.
